  * GMP::Z.remove works as it is supposed to.
  * PDF documentation is extended.

0.2.1:
  * Got GMP::F(Fixnum) working, (I think it already was).
  * More and more documentation in PDF.

0.1.9:
  * Cleaning up more documentation in PDF format.

0.1.8:
  * Added test: tc_division, in progress.

  * Added to_f ==> to_d aliases for GMP::Q and GMP::F.

0.1.7:
  * Added tests: tc_shifts_last_bits, tc_logical_roots, tc_f_precision,
    tc_f_arithmetics_coersion, tc_default_prec
  * Unit test results: 54 tests, 326 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
  * Fixed defect in GMP::F.sub when argument is Bignum
  * Fixed defect in GMP::F.div when argument is Bignum
  * Added documentation "manual" in form of a LaTeX-based PDF. Very incomplete
  * as of yet.

0.1.6.2:
  * Added optional argument to GMP::Z.to_s. Supply base as either a Fixnum or
    a Symbol like :hex to get the string in a different base.

0.1.6:
  * Tested on OS X 10.5.8 with Ruby 1.9.1. It's a go!
  * Tested on LinuxMint 7 with Ruby 1.8.7. It's a go! Ping me if you have Linux
    problems.
  * Added documentation.
  * Cleaned up source.
  * Added tests: tc_swap, tc_floor_ceil_truncate, tc_to_i_to_d

0.1.5:
 * Merged in reorg changes: Files like gmpz.c allow for documenting the C
   extension methods.
 * A good portion of the documentation has been written, may not be included
   yet, but can be generated with
