<p>gmp is library providing Ruby bindings to GMP library. Here is the introduction paragraph at http://gmplib.org/#WHAT :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers. There is no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory in the machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface.</p>

<p>The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications and research, Internet security applications, algebra systems, computational algebra research, etc.</p>

<p>GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands and for huge operands. The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, with highly optimised assembly code for the most common inner loops for a lot of CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>GMP is faster than any other bignum library. The advantage for GMP increases with the operand sizes for many operations, since GMP uses asymptotically faster algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The first GMP release was made in 1991. It is continually developed and maintained, with a new release about once a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>GMP is distributed under the GNU LGPL. This license makes the library free to use, share, and improve, and allows you to pass on the result. The license gives freedoms, but also sets firm restrictions on the use with non-free programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>GMP is part of the GNU project. For more information about the GNU project, please see the official GNU web site.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>GMP&#8217;s main target platforms are Unix-type systems, such as GNU/Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, Mac OS X/Darwin, BSD, AIX, etc. It also is known to work on Windoze in 32-bit mode.</p>

<p>GMP is brought to you by a team listed in the manual.</p>

<p>GMP is carefully developed and maintained, both technically and legally. We of course inspect and test contributed code carefully, but equally importantly we make sure we have the legal right to distribute the contributions, meaning users can safely use GMP. To achieve this, we will ask contributors to sign paperwork where they allow us to distribute their work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only GMP 4 or newer is supported. The following environments have been tested by me: gmp gem 0.5.41 on:</p>

<h2 id='classes'>Classes</h2>

<p>The GMP module is provided with following classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>GMP::Z - infinite precision integer numbers</li>

<li>GMP::Q - infinite precision rational numbers</li>

<li>GMP::F - arbitrary precision floating point numbers</li>

<li>GMP::RandState - states of individual random number generators</li>
</ul>

<p>Numbers are created by using new(). Constructors can take following arguments:</p>

<p>GMP::Z.new() GMP::Z.new(GMP::Z) GMP::Z.new(Fixnum) GMP::Z.new(Bignum) GMP::Z.new(String) GMP::Q.new() GMP::Q.new(GMP::Q) GMP::Q.new(String) GMP::Q.new(any GMP::Z initializer) GMP::Q.new(any GMP::Z initializer, any GMP::Z initializer) GMP::F.new() GMP::F.new(GMP::Z, precision=0) GMP::F.new(GMP::Q, precision=0) GMP::F.new(GMP::F) GMP::F.new(GMP::F, precision) GMP::F.new(String, precision=0) GMP::F.new(Fixnum, precision=0) GMP::F.new(Bignum, precision=0) GMP::F.new(Float, precision=0) GMP::RandState.new([algorithm] [, algorithm_args])</p>

<p>You can also call them as: GMP.Z(args) GMP.Q(args) GMP.F(args) GMP.RandState()</p>

<h2 id='functional_mappings'>Functional Mappings</h2>

<p>In order to align better with the GMP paradigms of using return arguments, I have started creating &#8220;functional mappings&#8221;, singleton methods that map directly to functions in GMP. These methods take return arguments, so that passing an object to a functional mapping may change the object itself. For example:</p>

<p>a = GMP::Z(0) b = GMP::Z(13) c = GMP::Z(17) GMP::Z.add(a, b, c) a #=&gt; 30</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a fun list of all of the functional mappings written so far:</p>

<p>GMP::Z .abs .add .addmul .cdiv_q_2exp .cdiv_r_2exp .com .divexact .fdiv_q_2exp .fdiv_r_2exp .lcm .mul .mul_2exp .neg .nextprime .sqrt .sub .submul .tdiv_q_2exp .tdiv_r_2exp</p>

<h2 id='documentation'>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>This README (https://github.com/srawlins/gmp)</li>

<li>Loren Segal and the guys at RubyGems.org are badasses. YARDoc is here: http://rubydoc.info/gems/gmp/frames</li>

<li>There should be a manual.pdf at https://github.com/srawlins/gmp/blob/master/manual.pdf I spend waaay too much time working on this, but it looks very pretty.</li>

<li>CHANGELOG (https://github.com/srawlins/gmp/blob/master/CHANGELOG)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='testing'>Testing</h2>

<p>Tests can be run with:</p>

<p>cd test ruby unit_tests.rb</p>

<p>If you have the unit_test gem installed, all tests should pass. Otherwise, one test may error. I imagine there is a bug in Ruby&#8217;s built-in Test::Unit package that is fixed with the unit_test gem.</p>

<h2 id='known_issues'>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t call GMP::RandState(:lc_2exp_size). Give a 2nd arg.</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t use multiple assignment (a = b = GMP::Z(0)) with functional mappings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='precision'>Precision</h2>

<p>Precision can be explicitely set as second argument for GMP::F.new().</p>

<p>If there is no explicit precision, highest precision of all GMP::F arguments is used. That doesn&#8217;t ensure that result will be exact. For details, consult any paper about floating point arithmetics.</p>

<p>Default precision can be explicitely set by passing 0 as the second argument for to GMP::F.new(). In particular, you can set precision of copy of GMP::F object by: new_obj = GMP::F.new(old_obj, 0)</p>

<p>Precision argument, and default_precision will be rounded up to whatever GMP thinks is appropriate.</p>

<h2 id='benchmarking'>Benchmarking</h2>

<p>&#8220;GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible.&#8221; Therefore, I believe it is very important for GMP, and its various language bindings to be benchmarked. In recent years, the GMP team developed GMPbench, an elegant, weighted benchmark. Currently, at http://www.gmplib.org/gmpbench.html they maintain a list of recent benchmark results, broken down by CPU, CPU freq, ABI, and compiler flags; GMPbench compares different processor&#8217;s performance against eachother, rather than GMP against other bignum libraries, or comparing different versions of GMP.</p>

<p>I intend to build a plug-in to GMPbench that will test the ruby gmp gem. The results of this benchmark should be directly comparable with the results of GMP (on same CPU, etc.). Rather than write a benchmark from the ground up, or try to emulate what GMPbench does, a plug-in will allow for this type of comparison. And in fact, GMPbench is (perhaps intentionally) written perfectly to allow for plugging in.</p>

<p>Various scores are derived from GMPbench by running the <tt>runbench</tt> script. This script compiles and runs various individual programs that measure the performance of base functions, such as multiply, and app functions such as rsa.</p>

<p>The gmp gem benchmark uses the GMPbench framework (that is, runbench, gexpr, and the timing methods), and plugs in ruby scripts as the individual programs. Right now, there are only three such plugged in ruby scripts:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiply - measures performance of multiplying (or squaring) GMP::Z objects whose size (in bits) is given by 1 or 2 operands.</li>

<li>divide - measures performance of dividing two GMP::Z objects (using tdiv) whose size (in bits) is given by 2 operands.</li>

<li>rsa - measures performance of using RSA to sign messages. The size of pq, the product of the two co-prime GMP::Z objects, p and q, is given by 1 operand.</li>
</ul>
<b>OOOLLLDDD... UPDATE PLZ</b>
<p>My guess is that the increase in ruby gmp gem overhead is caused by increased efficiency in GMP; the inefficiencies of the gmp gem are relatively greater.</p>
